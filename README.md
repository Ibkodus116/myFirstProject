## My Process

- I used strcitly CSS and HTML
- Built the HTML page first
- Took my time to design the CSS
- had challenges with background but i overcame
- the hovering was my last phase of design also done with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

It was really a tough time building this despite how simple it looks. my greatest challenge was creating the bckgorund design because it required the use of image and color, but all thanks i overcame, i will be doing more of this and i really hope it brings about more progress for me. the majore thing learnt here is setting the background up I'm so happy i was able to do it easily.


### Continued development

i will be doing more of CSS as it seems to be the area i really find challenging although my aim is way above that.
